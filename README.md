## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Leaflet JS


### What I learned

I learned how to use mix blend mode, slide animation for buttons, and how to use Leaflet JS to integrate a customized interactive map into the site.
It was difficult for me to place the grid elements with precision in order to be fully responsive.

### Continued development

Need to improve grid skills
